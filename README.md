# Quiz

Simple crypto-based quiz game using the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com).

## How it works
After connecting your wallet, you can create a challenge, which generates a link you can share with your friends. Every participant contributes an equal amount of ETH to the prize pool, which is stored in an escrow smart contract, and the entire prize pool gets transferred to the winner at the end of the game. In the future, there will be other game modes, though.

## Game rules and scoring
On challenge creation, you will be able to choose a category for the questions. For every correct answer, 10 points multiplied by the time left, will be awarded. This is to ensure that points are awarded for both speed and accuracy. In the initial implementation of the game, there are no tiebreakers, as the occurence of a tie is deemed unlikely.
